                    Meet Mike Spirakis, President of <b>Producer Activity LLC.</b> Commonly referred to as <b>The Producer Whisperer</b>, Mike has helped countless agencies and producers across the county to generate <b>multiple millions in new business revenue</b>. Mike has spent two decades re-engineering the way producers approach and create new business activity. Whether it’s in one of Mike’s hands-on, roll-up-your-sleeves Boot Camps, or through a custom training program, Mike’s approach has proven time and time again to drive NEW revenue. Here's what his students have to say.

                    <br>
                    Mike focuses on three distinct types of producers.  The first is newer to the industry, the second is experienced producers who are "stuck" and need help re - energizing, and the third are go-getters who are looking for new tools to drive more revenue.  He is an expert at calling, call scripts, email campaigns and prospecting accountability.  All of this leading to higher success rates of scheduling meetings and producing revenue.  Mike has championed the changing sale styles through multiple decades moving from the early days' ex-date and transaction selling through solution selling to today's insight selling environment.

                <div class="text" id="summary-text">Learning the skills to create activity is one of the most important steps in the on-boarding process and making sure tenured producers have the proper tools to succeed is equally important. The insurance industry has gained a heightened awareness of the importance of organic growth. For new producers the ability to introduce them to this necessary skill, and make them productive and effective in the shortest possible time, becomes a critical business issue. Simply put, agencies that get new producers up to speed and prospecting sooner create great learning opportunities, improve on-boarding success and greatly reduce new hire investment cost. For tenured producers, giving them new tools and training to get more “at bats’ will give your experienced team the ability to drive the revenue needed for both producer and agency success as well.
